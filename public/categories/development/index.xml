Hopefully these notes serve as more than a warning.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s rarely possible to know every way you will want to access your data. Riak has secondary indices (2i) but if you don&amp;rsquo;t have one that represents what you want to query, it can be time consuming to populate one of these when you have a lot of documents. Ad-hoc queries are rarely where a database will shine, but when you have a one-off job, sometimes Map/Reduce is the only option you have.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Find activate-immediately services that lack an activate method</title><link>https://thecarlhall.github.io/post/find-activate-immediately-services-that-lack-an-activate-method/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>carl@halls.farm (Carl Hall)</author><guid>https://thecarlhall.github.io/post/find-activate-immediately-services-that-lack-an-activate-method/</guid><description>&lt;p>Immediate service activation in OSGi can be tricky but there are &lt;a href="http://thecarlhall.wordpress.com/2011/02/04/when-to-immediately-activate-an-osgi-component/" title="some basic rules to consider">some basic rules to consider&lt;/a>.

This can show up as &lt;code>NoClassDefFoundError&lt;/code>, &lt;code>ClassNotFoundException&lt;/code> or as log output in a stacktrace from bundle resolution.

Even with good management of these dependencies, a nice visual layout of things can really help you see how your bundles are interconnected and give you the power to start separating some connections if you graph starts to hit cyclical dependencies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Committer Status on Apache Sling</title><link>https://thecarlhall.github.io/post/committer-status-on-apache-sling/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>carl@halls.farm (Carl Hall)</author><guid>https://thecarlhall.github.io/post/committer-status-on-apache-sling/</guid><description>&lt;p>I woke up this morning to the fantastic news that I&amp;rsquo;ve been offered committer status on Apache Sling!

This allows components to delay their possibly expensive activation until the component is first accessed. At the very least it allows the OSGi platform to consume resources as needed. No sense is sucking up those server resources for something that can wait.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As developers start their adventure into OSGi, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a pattern creeping up that I&amp;rsquo;m not sure folks are aware of: j_ust because you like your component doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it needs to start immediately._ Unless your component has something it needs to do before other components can do their work, there&amp;rsquo;s little need to start a component immediately. A lot of times, the work can be moved into the bundle activator or is fine being delayed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LDAP Authentication &amp;amp; Authorization Dissected and Digested</title><link>https://thecarlhall.github.io/post/ldap-authentication-authorization-dissected-and-digested/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>carl@halls.farm (Carl Hall)</author><guid>https://thecarlhall.github.io/post/ldap-authentication-authorization-dissected-and-digested/</guid><description>&lt;p>LDAP is one of those things that I&amp;rsquo;ve integrated with a few times but never put enough energy into to really get the details or understand it much.Â  There&amp;rsquo;s always been someone I can bounce questions off of and thankfully those people were available again as I started working out the details of performing LDAP authentication.&lt;/p>

If you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable with your package manager feel free to replace the aptitude command with your local command.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to dig deeper into ruby, rails and the whole suite of tools available for them and have hit my knee on several things along the way. I&amp;rsquo;m no stranger to downloading things to download things to do things; I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing that in Java since 1996. I&amp;rsquo;ve also been kicking the tires on Ubuntu sense back before they got their naming scheme together and Debian even before that. I totally dig the Debian/Ubuntu way of install by deb packages. But with ruby, like Java, I feel it is best setup a machine by minimizing the use of apt (apt-get, aptitude, etc) and downloading the tools you need directly. I don&amp;rsquo;t let aptitude install Eclipse, Xalan, servlet-api or any of the other tools/libraries I use on top of the JVM and this is the route I have ended up going with when setting up ruby as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Setting "quoted-printable" In A commons-email Body Part</title><link>https://thecarlhall.github.io/post/setting-quoted-printable-in-a-commons-email-body-part/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>carl@halls.farm (Carl Hall)</author><guid>https://thecarlhall.github.io/post/setting-quoted-printable-in-a-commons-email-body-part/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m revamping the inner workings of a mail sending tool to use &lt;a href="http://commons.apache.org/email">commons-email&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>Sun decided ages ago that JavaMail and the Java Activation Framework should be released as separate artifacts and no one really cared. If you need JavaMail, you knew to also include JAF as Sun&amp;rsquo;s JavaMail page also told what version of JAF to use. Using this same approach, I created and deployed separate bundles for javax.activation and javax.mail. As soon as I tried to send the first test email, I found trouble.
