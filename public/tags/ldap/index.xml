&lt;p>The steps below are general enough to be used by anyone and will hopefully shed some light into the steps performed in LDAP authentication.  The process below also includes some steps for authorization.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>keytool is Strict</title><link>https://thecarlhall.github.io/post/keychain-is-strict/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>carl@halls.farm (Carl Hall)</author><guid>https://thecarlhall.github.io/post/keychain-is-strict/</guid><description>&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s say you are setting up a connection to an LDAP server and need to get your security bits in place.  To get the certificate chain from the server, you may do something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>openssl s_client -showcerts -connect dir.example.com:636 &amp;gt; cert_chain.pem&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Now with the output of that, you want to create or add to a keystore. That command looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>keytool -import -storetype jks -keystore dir_example.jks -storepass dir-example -file cert_chain.pem -alias ldap-ca -noprompt&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
