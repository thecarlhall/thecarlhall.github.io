&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s rarely possible to know every way you will want to access your data. Riak has secondary indices (2i) but if you don&amp;rsquo;t have one that represents what you want to query, it can be time consuming to populate one of these when you have a lot of documents. Ad-hoc queries are rarely where a database will shine, but when you have a one-off job, sometimes Map/Reduce is the only option you have.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
