&lt;p>Sun decided ages ago that JavaMail and the Java Activation Framework should be released as separate artifacts and no one really cared. If you need JavaMail, you knew to also include JAF as Sun&amp;rsquo;s JavaMail page also told what version of JAF to use. Using this same approach, I created and deployed separate bundles for javax.activation and javax.mail. As soon as I tried to send the first test email, I found trouble. The most basic of email content types, text/plain, could not be sent.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
