This allows components to delay their possibly expensive activation until the component is first accessed. At the very least it allows the OSGi platform to consume resources as needed. No sense is sucking up those server resources for something that can wait.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As developers start their adventure into OSGi, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a pattern creeping up that I&amp;rsquo;m not sure folks are aware of: j_ust because you like your component doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it needs to start immediately._ Unless your component has something it needs to do before other components can do their work, there&amp;rsquo;s little need to start a component immediately. A lot of times, the work can be moved into the bundle activator or is fine being delayed.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
