I use Gmail and several of the other Google applications (calendar, reader, docs, etc). Google has added offline support to a few of these apps via their Google Gears Firefox addon. This can be great news unless you are running 64-big linux. There is not an official release of Google Gears of 64-bit linux. There is, however, &lt;a href="http://tinyurl.com/gears64" title="Google Gears 64 for Linux">an unofficial and totally sweet build available&lt;/a>. The builder does a great job of staying up to date with the builds usually within a release or two of the official builds. If you travel or just like to handle email and such when offline, this can be a great help. Enjoy!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
