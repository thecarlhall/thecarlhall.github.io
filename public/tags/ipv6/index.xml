After some digging around, it was discovered that, for whatever reason, the JUnit runner was trying to create a network connection and couldn&amp;rsquo;t. He tried to perform an update of Eclipse plugins and that failed also, for the same network connectivity reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a lot of digging and much gnashing of teeth, &lt;a href="http://pvaneynd.livejournal.com/132635.html">he came across this page&lt;/a> which outlines an issue where Java has started connecting using IPv6. We&amp;rsquo;re not sure if this is a Debian package issue or something from elsewhere but thankfully the LiveJournal page outlines a couple of fixes. The fix performed at the system level rather than by Java properties is what fixed things for him.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
