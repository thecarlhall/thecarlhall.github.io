After some digging around, it was discovered that, for whatever reason, the JUnit runner was trying to create a network connection and couldn&amp;rsquo;t. He tried to perform an update of Eclipse plugins and that failed also, for the same network connectivity reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a lot of digging and much gnashing of teeth, &lt;a href="http://pvaneynd.livejournal.com/132635.html">he came across this page&lt;/a> which outlines an issue where Java has started connecting using IPv6. We&amp;rsquo;re not sure if this is a Debian package issue or something from elsewhere but thankfully the LiveJournal page outlines a couple of fixes. The fix performed at the system level rather than by Java properties is what fixed things for him.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Clicking Things</title><link>https://thecarlhall.github.io/post/clicking-things/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Dec 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>carl@halls.farm (Carl Hall)</author><guid>https://thecarlhall.github.io/post/clicking-things/</guid><description>&lt;p>For a month or so now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been having problems with clicking buttons in &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse&lt;/a> and in &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/">Flash&lt;/a>. After asking in the Eclipse IRC room, I was able to find an answer that actually fixes both Eclipse and Flash.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Eclipse&lt;/strong> (from &lt;a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/IRC_FAQ#Eclipse_buttons_in_dialogs_and_other_places_are_not_working_for_me_if_I_click_them_with_the_mouse._They_work_if_I_use_the_mnemonic_key_though.2C_what.27s_going_on.3F">the wiki&lt;/a>) I&amp;rsquo;ve created a startup script that sets the following system property. &lt;code>export GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=true&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Flash&lt;/strong> (from &lt;a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=8409479">this post&lt;/a>) Pretty much the same fix as above but made in a different place. In &lt;em>/usr/lib/nspluginwrapper/i386/linux/npviewer&lt;/em>, add the following: &lt;code>export GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1&lt;/code>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
