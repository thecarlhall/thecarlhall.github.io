With so many tools, there&amp;rsquo;s bound to be some overlap and while some of that overlap is perturbing, some of it is really useful! I already maintain &lt;a href="http://follow.sf.net">a project for following log files&lt;/a> but this is such a common need that other projects have implemented the same functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use &amp;rsquo;less&amp;rsquo; whenever I need to quickly take a look through something or keep something from blowing past me in some long output. It&amp;rsquo;s recently been brought to my attention that not only will &amp;rsquo;less&amp;rsquo; allow me to page the contents of something, it will also actively follow something. When you&amp;rsquo;re in &amp;rsquo;less&amp;rsquo; just press &amp;lsquo;F&amp;rsquo; (uppercase F) and you&amp;rsquo;ll be following right along. Use Ctrl+c to stop following and go back to a standard &amp;rsquo;less&amp;rsquo; session. Pretty cool, huh?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
