For linux users, there's a huge toolbox of things out there to allow us to perform our job more efficiently. With so many tools, there's bound to be some overlap and while some of that overlap is perturbing, some of it is really useful! I already maintain [a project for following log files](http://follow.sf.net) but this is such a common need that other projects have implemented the same functionality.

I use 'less' whenever I need to quickly take a look through something or keep something from blowing past me in some long output. It's recently been brought to my attention that not only will 'less' allow me to page the contents of something, it will also actively follow something. When you're in 'less' just press 'F' (uppercase F) and you'll be following right along. Use Ctrl+c to stop following and go back to a standard 'less' session. Pretty cool, huh?
