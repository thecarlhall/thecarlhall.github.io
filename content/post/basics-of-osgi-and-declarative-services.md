This is a slide deck for a talk I gave at the Sakai 2010 conference in lovely Denver, Colorado. The title to the talk was "Using OSGi in Nakamura" which was my original intention, but after reviewing the slides I seemed to have given a talk about the basics of OSGi. Good information under a wrong marquee.

No matter the intention, I found today that I needed to refer to the slides for setting up an activator, so I'm reposting it here to give myself and hopefully others faster access. Be on the lookout for a repeat performance of this presentation at the Sakai 2011 conference in Los Angeles. I might even try to show it around a bit once the European conference is announced.
