I woke up this morning to the fantastic news that I've been offered committer status on Apache Sling! I graciously and excitedly accepted the opportunity to become an Apache committer. The various points of processing are in motion, so expect to see more Sling posts from me as I get ramped up into being a more productive member of Apache Sling.
