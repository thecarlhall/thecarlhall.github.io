While my previous post does detail how to remove remote branches from your repo, I fear that it mistakenly sends you down that path as a means of renaming branches from a remote repo. Like most other functionality, if you think Git should already have it, it probably does.  
  
To rename a remote repo to something else just use (following previous example): `git remote rename origin moe`

Tada!
