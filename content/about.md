I spent the first very long period of my life schooling and growing up in Georgia. Eventually [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu) became interesting in a few ways (undergrad BS ISyE, started MS Comp Sci & Eng, Research Engineer for T-Square LMS). A fun decade-ish jaunt in Portland, Oregon was quite the adventure at [Cloudability](https://www.apptio.com/products/cloudability/). Me and the fam returned to Atlanta. I was a Software Development Manager at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) for a while, but he left for Solutions Architecture at [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com).Â  My free time is still spent chasing his son, sometimes playing guitar, over-optimizing everything, and wondering where the time has gone.

I used to write a bit about software development when I was building [OSGi](https://www.osgi.org/) applications. Now I'm working in field engineering / solutions architecture and management. New posts are likely to be in those areas.
