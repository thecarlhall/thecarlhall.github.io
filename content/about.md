Carl was a transplant to Portland, OR from Georgia, but he came home a f ew years ago.  He was a Software Development Manager at Amazon Web Services, too, but he left that for Solutions Architecture at Databricks.  His free time is still spent chasing his son, sometimes playing guitar, over-optimizing everything, and wondering where the time has gone.
